# Women Crime Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crimes against women in India between 2001 and 2021. The dataset used contains crime statistics from various states and union territories of India, focusing on different types of crimes committed against women.

The analysis includes data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization techniques to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns in crimes against women.
- Visualize the data using various charts and graphs to identify key insights.
- Analyze crime trends over time and across different states.
- Identify the most common types of crimes against women.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of records of crimes against women in India from 2001 to 2021. The data includes:
- Year-wise crime statistics
- State-wise crime distribution
- Crime categories (e.g., domestic violence, dowry deaths, rape, etc.)
- Total number of reported cases

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following EDA techniques were applied:
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling Missing Values
- Statistical Summary and Aggregations
- Trend Analysis (Year-wise & State-wise)
- Correlation Analysis between different crime types

## Visualizations Created
To gain insights, various visualizations were generated:
- **Line Charts**: To show trends in crimes over the years.
- **Bar Charts**: To compare state-wise crime rates.

## Key Findings
- Certain states report higher crime rates consistently.
- Some crime types have increased significantly over the years.
- There is a correlation between certain types of crimes.
- Policy changes and awareness programs seem to have an impact on crime trends in specific years.
